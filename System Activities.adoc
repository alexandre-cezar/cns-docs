== Searching Activities
Creating specific search is as simple as clicking on an interesting field, and it will automatically be added to your query. You can continue selecting fields to match the exact traffic you are interested in. +

You can also manually select the fields and add the values directly in the search bar.

[TIP]
If you hold the _shift_ key before selecting a field, it will be added as a _negation_ to your query

== Using Saved Queries
Once you create a query that may be reused in the future, you can save it and reapply it later.

For that, simply click the _Save_ button, provide a name to your Search and the query will be added to your collection

You can visit this anytime in the future to reapply your saved queries or delete them.
