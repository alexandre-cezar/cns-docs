This opens the Authorization Wizard and after your provide a name to the Authorization and click next, it will request additional information, as follows:

* Subject -> The objects that indicates where the authorization should apply to. There's always a requirement for 2 conditions and a target namespace (if a parent is select, the authorization will propagate to its children)
