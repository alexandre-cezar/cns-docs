Another way to create an External Network is directly in the flow logs page.

For flows that have a source or destination classified as "somewhere" an additional button, called "Flow Analysis" becomes available under "Action"

Enforcers will suggest the FQDN of the External Network if there's a DNS Lookup result associated with that IP
