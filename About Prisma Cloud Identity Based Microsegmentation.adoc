== About

Prisma Cloud Identity-Based Microsegmentation is designed to work in a zero-trust model where all communications are authenticated and authorized with a cryptographically-signed identity. Every one of your workloads has such an identity to protect them against attacks. All connections are also logged (Zero Trust requirement)

Using Prisma Cloud Identity-Based Microsegmentation, you donâ€™t need to rely on unmanageable, error-prone policies based on IP addresses or relaxed controls that may add gaps into your network security posture. It implements a least privilege network model for your environment, regardless of where your application is running.

Enforcing a distributed, homogeneous security policy per workload independent of network or infrastructure configuration, you enable uniform security orchestration across multi-cloud and traditional Datacenter environments.
