Prisma Cloud Microsegmentation alerts are used on situations where you have specific controls you want to enforce and be alerted when a violation occurs:

== Alert Types
There are 4 specific alert types supported on Prisma Cloud Microsegmentation:

* Ruleset -> Alerts are generated when traffic matches a specific ruleset.

* Host Processing Units -> Alerts are generated when a Host PU is connected or disconnected.

* Enforcer -> Alerts are generated when an Enforcer is connected or disconnected

* Audit -> Alerts are generated when a specific action is executed in the system.

== Alert Components
There's always two components to an alert:

* Integration -> Defines the downstream system where alerts will be forwarded to. +
Today, email and Slack are supported integrations

* Automation -> Defines what Alert type is going to be created and its triggers.

== Creating an Integration
Navigate to _Manage/Alerts and Automations_ and click on the Integrations tab.

Click on the _"Add"_ button on the right and select the Integration you want to create.

[IMPORTANT]
Integrations and Automations are namespace specific and as such, multiple integrations and automations can be leveraged independent of each other, although propagation is supported from parent to children.
