= Alerts and Automations
Alexandre Cezar <acezar@paloaltonetworks.com> 1.0, April 25, 2022:

Prisma Cloud Microsegmentation alerts are used on situations where you have specific controls you want to enforce and get immediate alerts when a violation happens:

== Alert Types
There are 4 specific alert types supported on Prisma Cloud Microsegmentation:

* Ruleset -> Alerts are generated when traffic matches a specific ruleset.

* Host Processing Units -> Alerts are generated when a Host PU is connected or disconnected.

* Enforcer -> Alerts are generated when an Enforcer is connected or disconnected

* Audit -> Alerts are generated when a specific action is executed in the system.

There's always two components to an alert:

* Integration -> Defines the downstream system where alerts will be forwarded to.
Today, email and slack are supported integrations

* Automation -> Defines what Alert type is going to be created and the triggers for an alarm to be generated

== Creating an Integration
Navigate to _Manage/Alerts and Automations_ and click on the Integrations tab.

Click on the _"Add"_ button on the right and select the Integration you want to create.

[NOTE]
You cannot edit an Integration once it's created.

== Creating an Automation
Navigate to _Manage/Alerts and Automations_ and click on the Automations tab.

Click on the _"Add"_ button on the right and select the Automation type you want to create.

=== Host PU Automation details
The Host PU Automation Wizard will request the following information:

[IMPORTANT]
Integrations and Automations are namespace specific and as such, multiple integrations and automations can be leveraged independent of each other, although propagation is supported from parent to children.
