== What is an Enforcer Alarm?
Certain events or failures may raise a specific alert by an Enforcer, such as a failure to enforce a ruleset or to create a processing unit. Also, Enforcer will raise alarms if they detect an attempt to tamper with its configurations or state.

Once this happens, the alert will be displayed under System Activities/Alarms
