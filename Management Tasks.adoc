Common operational tasks, besides rulesets, external networks and namespaces evolve around 3 additional topics:

* Upgrade Enforcers

* Import/Export the configuration

* Manage certificates and App credentials

Let's look into each topic in more details.

== Upgrading Enforcers
You can upgrade Enforcers in two ways:

* Using the Microsegmentation Console

* Using apoctl

=== Upgrade Enforcers using the Microsegmentation Console

Navigate to Agent/Enforcers and verify the Enforcer version by expanding its details

[TIP]
You can identify if a new Enforcer version is available when the upgrade button appears for your Enforcers.

You can select a single or multiple Enforcer by enabling the _multiselect_ option

==== Single Enforcer upgrade

==== Multiple Enforcers upgrade

The UI will list the selected Enforcer(s) versions and the version you want to upgrade to (latest or a custom version) +

Once the upgrade process begun, Enforcers will briefly disconnect and its status will transition from "disconnected migration running" back to "connected"

You can check again at the Enforcer version to confirm that it is now in the desired version.

=== Upgrade Enforcers using apoctl
To upgrade an Enforcer using apoctl, run the command
`apoctl enforcer switch-to --target-version <version> -n <namespace> --confirm` to upgrade all Enforcers on that namespace. You can also point to a specific Enforcer ID if you want to upgrade just a single Enforcer.

== Importing/Exporting configurations
Importing and Exporting configuration is a common task if you implement microsegmentation using "policy as code" concepts.

=== Exporting Configurations
Select the namespace of interest, navigate to Manage/Data Management, select the objects you want to export, assign a label to the file and click on _Download_

=== Importing Configurations
Navigate to Manage/Data Management, choose the namespace where you want to import the objects (if on a parent), select the file you want to import,  _Import_

=== Exporting/Importing configurations using apoctl
You can use `apoctl` to manage your configurations.

You can export a configuration using the command `apoctl api export --label "<label>" -n <namespace> -f <filename>`

You can import a configuration using the command `apoctl api import -f <filename> -n <namespace>`

For additional options, please check the `apoctl` documentation.

== Managing Certificates and App Credentials
You can manage external certificates and credentials using the Prisma Cloud console.

=== Create an App Credential
Navigate to Manage/Credentials and select the App Credentials tab

* Step 1 -> Click on the _+_ sign to create a new App Credential

* Step 2 -> Name it and define the permissions you want to assign to the credential

* Step 3 -> Save it in the desired format.

[TIP]
If you're using the app credential to use it with `apoctl`, save it as an App Credential

For more details about roles and permissions, please read this https://github.com/alexandre-cezar/cns-docs/blob/main/Roles%20and%20Permissions.adoc[page]

=== Renew an App Credential
You can use renew your app credentials. To do this, click on the _Renew_ icon

A warning message will be displayed stating that the certificate will be renewed and the old certificate will stop working 12h after this operation is done.

Once renewed, a new certificate is provided, and it needs to be distributed to its proper users/services

=== Delete an App Credential
To delete an App Credential, simply click on the delete button.

=== Import an external TLS Certificate
For some tasks that involved external resources that use SSL certificates such as: +

* Rulesets that traverses TLS enabled Load Balancers)
* TLS enabled syslog collectors
* TLS enabled proxies

You need to import the device certificate into Prisma Cloud console.

In order to do this, navigate to Manage/Certificates and select the Certificate Management tab

* Step 1 -> Click on the _New Service Certificate_ icon

* Step 2 -> Import the public and private keys into the console and click on Create
