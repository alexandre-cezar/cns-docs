The `+completion+` command is used to generate shell completion suggestions.
The command may be ran in the current shell. For persistence the command should
be added to the users shell profile file.

Example with Bash Shell:

. <(apoctl completion bash)

 Example with Zsh Shell:

. <(apoctl completion zsh)
